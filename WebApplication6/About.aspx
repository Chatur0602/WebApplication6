  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <a> Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. Kozy Kitchen is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night.
        Most importantly, Kozy Kitchen connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.</a>
        
  <h2>Our History</h2>
        <a >Every day, cooks from around the world publish recipes and inspire one another through recipe photos, ratings, reviews, and videos. The combination of the Kozy Kitchen community with our team of editorial and kitchen professionals provides authority found nowhere else on the internet and has turned the brand into an indispensable resource for cooks of all skill levels.</a>
  <h2>The KozyKitchen Community</h2>
        <a >The heart of Kozy Kitchen is our community of home cooks who share their beloved family recipes, create new recipes, and photograph, rate, and review each other's recipes. Each week, more than 15 million registered members add more than 2,000 recipe ratings, 800 new recipe photos, and almost 200 new recipes to the site. And every minute of every day, 27 people are saving recipes they love or want to try later.
</a>

  <h2>Community Guidelines</h2>
        <a >We moderate every review and photograph added to a recipe. When leaving reviews, we ask that you remember that a fellow Kozy Kitchen community member has shared their recipe with you. Constructive feedback is always welcome, but rude, mean, disrespectful, or spammy comments are not welcome and will not be approved.</a>
